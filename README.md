# 🎓 Face Recognition Attendance System

An **AI-based Attendance System** built using **Python**, **OpenCV**, and **Face Recognition**.  
It automatically detects and recognizes faces from a live webcam feed and marks attendance in a CSV file with timestamps.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Real-time face detection using OpenCV  
- 🤖 Face recognition using `face_recognition` library (based on dlib)  
- 🧠 Machine learning-based encoding for registered users  
- 🗂️ Automatic attendance marking in `attendance.csv`  
- 🕒 Records timestamp for each entry  
- 📸 Easy to add new users by simply placing their images in the `Images/` folder

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.8+**
- **OpenCV** – for real-time image capturing and processing  
- **face_recognition** – for facial encoding and matching  
- **NumPy & Pandas** – for data handling and storage  
- **dlib** (installed with face_recognition) – for deep learning-based face encoding
